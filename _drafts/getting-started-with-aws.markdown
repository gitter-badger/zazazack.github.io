Yeah, so **Amazon Web Services** is pretty cool. If you're interested in learning how to use AWS to host a site or application, I highly recommend following their tutorial [Hosting a Web App on Amazon Web Services][tutorial]. The tutorial gives a good overview of how AWS services work together by incorporating many fundamental cloud hosting concepts and core AWS services.
